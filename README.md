# Simple_Simulation_Blockchain
 
# 🏗️ Simple Blockchain Simulation

This is a **basic blockchain project** created for learning purposes in my **B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering** coursework. It demonstrates how a blockchain works using Python by creating blocks, linking them using hashes, and ensuring security.

## 📌 Features
✔️ Creates a **chain of blocks**  
✔️ Each block stores **index, timestamp, data, previous hash**  
✔️ Uses **SHA-256 hashing** for security  
✔️ Simple and easy to understand  

## 📂 Project Files  
📄 `blockchain.py` → Main Python file that runs the blockchain  
📄 `README.md` → Project documentation (this file)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x** 🐍  
- **SHA-256 Hashing** 🔐  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
1️⃣ Install **Python** (if not installed)  
2️⃣ Download the project files or **clone the repository using GitHub Desktop**  
3️⃣ Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder  
4️⃣ Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python blockchain.py
5️⃣ The program will show blocks being created and linked together! 🎉
